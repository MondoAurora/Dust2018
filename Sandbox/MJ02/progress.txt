** LOG **

* 20190225 *
Global identification seems to be a bad idea; should use local Factory link type 
(that requires target type support and configured connection between the owner 
and the factory create method to pass parameters before initialization, now in a callback)

* 20190224 *
type default services, configure gui elements accordingly
entity invocation by type, owner and unique id (temp if missing)
make MontruDesktop and MontruControl, type array for sorting, draw and update on change

* 20190218 *
context entity management added
lazy entity creation for enum keys (no need to configure all needed entities)
Binary management, testing on Json load
drop file on editor, load and display
preparing for save
