** TASKS **

* IMMEDIATE
check "Net" unit creation
"Raw" att should not persist


* NEXT
proxy subnet with child contexts
 - online (direct view of parent entities) / offline (clone all seen entities immediately)
 - commit into parent context (down) and child (up) on request

send and process last known commit id


* LONGER
control structs are transparent relays?

WOW> a Message can have a "probe" flag and collect all entities it traversed. That can be handled
in the BinaryConnector, send function, thus collect the results from messages created locally
by the called services: when replacing the "msg" in the context, can check the flag and if set,
set in the child, and on return, add the visited entities to the original msg.


System is a unit, has unit refs
store hierarchy on units - one unit loader on system level (internal relay)

No map but factory, where the KEY is entity too (because it has meaning!)

save area size and open entity panel location, opened sources

Java source connection info, source generator

** LOG **

* 20190416 * 
YES allow saving messages (send only if dropped on head)

* 20190416 * dump

NO  resolver entity management (or: correct ID resolution?) - global ID idea dropped
YES Unit introduction - but moved from Meta to Comm as "document"
YES boot entities, change flag, save back to boot - in part, boot changed to separate units

Done during Montru complete refactor
 - drag model off the entity panel - create entity with that primary type
 - clean up drawing panels, remove factories?
 - separate Gui control logic from swing implementation


* 20190225 *
Global identification seems to be a bad idea; should use local Factory link type 
(that requires target type support and configured connection between the owner 
and the factory create method to pass parameters before initialization, now in a callback)

* 20190224 *
type default services, configure gui elements accordingly
entity invocation by type, owner and unique id (temp if missing)
make MontruDesktop and MontruControl, type array for sorting, draw and update on change

* 20190218 *
context entity management added
lazy entity creation for enum keys (no need to configure all needed entities)
Binary management, testing on Json load
drop file on editor, load and display
preparing for save

* 20190217 *
doclistener out to utils
generic search: list shows result bottom textarea show toString, doubleclick activate
