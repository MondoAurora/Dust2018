# Dust2018

This is a currently abandoned development path of Dust / Montru environment.

To try it, you need to create an Eclipse workspace with the following projects
 - Sandbox/MJ02 (main project)
 - Java/DustUtils (generic utilities)
 - Sandbox/ExtLib (used libraries)
 
The main project depends on the latter two, contains a launch configuration, "should work"... :-)

Recommended starting with the channel introduction video and follow the links in the description.

Best wishes!
