Relation as an entity may not refer to field, it merely connects two entities.
  field reference is another type, StructuralRelation.
  perhaps relation may extend to dynamic, expression based, where the field definition contains expression
  
  That may result similar access to enumerating direct and dynamic relations, or even "all", including those not containing field
